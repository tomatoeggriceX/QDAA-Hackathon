# QDAA-Hackathon
 This is a repository storing all the data management/analysis code and resulting images from the Queen's Data Analytics Association DataHack 2021. The files have not been modified post competition, and is as such quite disorganized. This project was completed in 8 hours. 
 
 The final presentation resulting from the data analysis is in the Presentation1 Powerpoint.
